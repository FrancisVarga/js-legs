Legs.js Todos
=============

- *Legs.View hash-route to selectors, don't allow any logic in view*

- *Legs.Actor factories should execute their assembly in-context, no need to pass prototype*

- *Legs.Mediator EventMap?*

- Legs.Service CRUD extension

- Legs.Router url-hashing actor

- Legs.Collection actor, make use of underscore?

- Legs.Loader? Just a thought?

- *Legs.Logger? maybe a util to provide namespace access to actors for debugging?*

- Find a way to prove actor testability (maybe this will be through creating Legs.Service and Legs.Router extensions)
